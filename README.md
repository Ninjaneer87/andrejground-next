Welcome to the [AndrejGround](https://andrejground.com/), my portfolio website project.

## Short history about AndrejGround

It started as a simple `HTML` | `CSS` | `JS` landing page back in 2020.
Here's the [code](https://github.com/Ninjaneer87/andrejground/), and the [link](https://andrejground.com/) to that project.

One year later (2021), I decided to recreate that idea, take it to the NEXT (JS) level, so to say :) and also buy the domain.
Initial technologies used back then were : `Next JS` | `Material UI(^4)` | `JavaScript` | `CSS` | `Mongo DB`.

Another year later (2022), I made some more changes/updates in terms of technologies, file naming/structure and visual design.
New technologies and tools in this version: `Next JS(^12)` | `TypeScript` | `React(^18)` | `Tailwind-CSS` | `Material UI(^5)` | `SCSS`, some custom react-hooks, a lot of performance and search engine optimization and a ton of code cleanup.
